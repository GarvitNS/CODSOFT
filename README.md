Hey, this Garvit Supekar. This is my github repository for my java  internship at codsoft company. This repository contains all tasks solutions.
In complete 15 day course, i solved this questions on a plain text editor. now, after testing them in cmd separately again, i am pasting them in this repository. 
To solve these questions i took help from online sources. I also used other references for unnderstanding what to do. Stackexchange was a huge help. 
I would like to thank Codsoft company for giving me this opportunity without which last 15 day coding streak wouldnt have happend.
